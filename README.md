# swarm-bots
TECHNOLOGY USED – 

Swarm-bots are a collection of mobile robots able to self-assemble and self-organize in order to solve problems that cannot be solved by a single robot using SWARM INTELLIGENCE. 
These robots combine the power of swarm intelligence with the flexibility of self-reconfiguration as aggregate swarm-bots can dynamically change their structure to match 
environmental variations.<br>

METHOD – 

Swarm-bot is made of master and slave protocol whereby the master controls the slave using RF module to carry out the desired task. 
The robots in the swarm should have some basic functions-
1) Communication between swarm bots: 
The Robots in the swarm exchange the information with each other and propagate the information to the whole swarm through autonomous 
behaviours resulting in the swarm-level cooperation.
2) Avoid collision between swarm robots.

OBJECTIVE – 

A swarm-bot are mobile robots which are able to self-assemble by connecting with each other to explore, navigate and transport heavy objects on rough terrains which will 
help in reduction of fuel consumption, accident avoidance.
